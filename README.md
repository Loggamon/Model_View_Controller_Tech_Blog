## Description

Why did you decide to build this project?

```
In this project, I wanted to demonstrate my knowledge of CRUD routes and databases, through the use of interconnected tables and data-persistance with session-storage.

To do this, I have set up a pseudo-social media platform to make posts about coding! Here you can create an account, check other people's posts/comments, and even make your own posts on the platform.
```

```

## Usage

How does your project work?

```
Like most social-media platforms, this site to allow to use CRUD routes; create posts/comments, get post/comments/pages, update posts, and delete posts. Becaause this site saves data to a database, any info you add/update/delete will persist, even after you log off!

This works through the use of controllers; js files that handle all of the CRUD routes.
Handlebars are also being used; and get requests are made, handlebars cycles to templates to render the one queried!
```

## Tests

To run this program:

```
This is the code for updating posts; it gave me the most grief!

const updateButtonHandler = async (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();

  const description = document.querySelector("#update-desc").value.trim();
  const id = document.querySelector('input[name="update-id"]').value;
  const title = document.querySelector("#update-title").value.trim();

  console.log(description);
  console.log(id);
  console.log(title);

  if (description) {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/posts/${id}`, {
      method: "PUT",
      body: JSON.stringify({ description, id, title }),
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
      },
    });
    console.log(response);
    if (response.ok) {
      document.location.replace("/dashboard");
    } else {
      alert("Oops! There was an issue commenting on this post!");
    }
  }
};

document
  .querySelector(".update-list")
  .addEventListener("submit", updateButtonHandler);
```
